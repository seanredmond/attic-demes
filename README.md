# Attic Demes Data

Basic data on Attic Demes in TSV and GeoJSON, extracted from Traill (1975).

For governmental purposes Ancient Attica (Athens and the surounding area) was divided after 508 BCE into 10 "tribes" (φυλαί), 3 "thirds" (τριττύες) and 149 "demes" (δῆμοι). Each deme was assigned to one of the three thirds (city, coast, or inland) and one of the tribes. The assignments were made so that every tribe countained city, coastal, and inland demes. When juries were selected, for instance, 50 citizens were selected by lot from each tribe (for a total of 500 jurors) and the jury could be expected to contain a good mix of demes and _trittyes_.

Men's names were recorded in official inscriptions with patronymic (father's name) and a demotic (deme name). For instance, the Athenian general Thrasybulus would be recorded as Θρασύβουλος Λύκου Στειριεύς _Thrasúboulos Lúkou Steirieús_, "Thrasybulus son of Lykos of Steiria." Women were excluded from full citizenship in Athens and they women appear in inscriptions they not named in this way.
